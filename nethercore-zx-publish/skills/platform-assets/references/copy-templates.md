## Universal Tips

**Hook Formula:**
`[Action verb] + [through/in/as] + [evocative setting/role] + [in this genre descriptor]`

**Feature Bullet Formula:**
`[Number/Quantity] + [specific thing] + [with/featuring] + [variety/benefit]`

**Avoid:**
- "Fun gameplay" (subjective, meaningless)
- "Addictive" (overused)
- "For all ages" (implied)
- Technical jargon (WASM, rollback, etc.)
- Comparisons to other games (unless very apt)

**Do:**
- Use active voice
- Be specific with numbers
- Highlight unique features first
- Mention multiplayer prominently if supported
- Keep under 200 words total
