# Character Design for Games

Practical frameworks for designing memorable player characters, NPCs, and antagonists. Focus on characters that serve gameplay and create emotional connections.

## Core Principle: Function First

Every character exists to serve a purpose:
- **Player characters**: Express player agency and skill
- **NPCs**: Provide services, information, or emotional connection
- **Antagonists**: Create obstacles and motivation
- **Companions**: Expand gameplay and relationships

Design function before personality, then add personality that reinforces function.

## Character Types

### Player Character (PC)

The player's avatar in the world. Key considerations:

**Blank Slate vs Defined Character**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Blank slate | Player projects themselves | Less narrative depth |
| Defined character | Stronger story potential | Players may not identify |
| Hybrid (defined past, player choices) | Balance of both | Complex to design |

**Design Questions:**
- Does the PC speak? (Silent vs voiced)
- How much backstory is revealed?
- What choices define the character?
- What abilities does the player unlock vs start with?

### Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

Characters the player interacts with but doesn't control.

**NPC Role Matrix:**

| Role | Function | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Mentor** | Teaches, guides early game | Tutorial giver, wise figure |
| **Merchant** | Trades resources | Shopkeeper, traveling trader |
| **Quest giver** | Provides objectives | Village elder, mysterious stranger |
| **Ally** | Assists in gameplay | Combat helper, information source |
| **Gatekeeper** | Controls access | Guard, keeper of secrets |
| **Flavor** | Adds world texture | Townsfolk, ambient characters |

**Key Rule:** Every NPC should serve at least one clear function.

### Antagonists

Characters who oppose the player.

**Antagonist Types:**

| Type | Relationship to Player | Design Focus |
|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Rival** | Equal who competes | Mirror of player strengths |
| **Tyrant** | Power imbalance to overcome | Oppressive presence |
| **Monster** | Inhuman threat | Primal fear, alien goals |
| **Fallen hero** | What player could become | Tragic connection |
| **System** | Abstract opposition | Pervasive, inescapable feel |

## Character Archetypes

Use archetypes as starting points, then add depth through contradiction.

|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **The Mysterious Stranger** | Hooks player into story | Has personal stake revealed later |
| **The Comic Relief** | Lightens tone | Surprising competence in crisis |
| **The Sage** | Provides information | Wrong about something important |
| **The Martyr** | Creates emotional stakes | Survival option the player can unlock |
| **The Rival** | Pushes player to improve | Eventual ally or tragic fall |

## Character Progression

### Ability Progression

How does the character grow in gameplay terms?

**Progression Model:**

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Unlock** | Gain new abilities | Metroidvanias, action-adventure |
| **Upgrade** | Improve existing abilities | Roguelikes, RPGs |
| **Transform** | Fundamentally change | Story-driven, horror |
| **Equip** | Change via items | Loot-focused games |
| **Master** | Same abilities, player skill grows | Skill-based games |

### Character Arc

For characters with narrative arcs:

**Arc Template:**
```
1. WANT: What the character desires
2. NEED: What they actually need (often different)
3. LIE: False belief holding them back
4. TRUTH: Realization that enables growth
5. CHANGE: How they're different at the end
```

**Arc Types:**

| Arc | Pattern | Emotional Payoff |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| **Positive** | Flaw → Growth → Redemption | Hope, satisfaction |
| **Negative** | Virtue → Corruption → Fall | Tragedy, warning |
| **Flat** | Strong belief → Tested → Proven right | Affirmation |
| **Disillusionment** | Belief → Challenge → Acceptance | Maturity |

## Party and Companion Design

### Party Composition

For games with multiple playable characters or companions:

**Balance Roles:**
- **Tank**: Absorbs damage
- **Damage**: Deals damage
- **Support**: Heals, buffs, utility
- **Specialist**: Unique abilities for specific situations

**Relationship Web:**
Map relationships between party members:
```
Character A ←→ Character B (relationship type)
     ↓
Character C (relationship type)
```

### Companion Design

Companions who follow the player:

**Companion Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear function (combat help, dialogue, navigation)
- [ ] Personality that contrasts with options
- [ ] Opinions on player choices (if applicable)
- [ ] Personal quest or development (for longer games)
- [ ] Distinct silhouette and voice

**The Companion Spectrum:**

| Autonomy | Player Control | Emotional Bond |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Fully independent | Low | Can be high (feels like person) |
| Semi-autonomous | Medium | Medium (partner feeling) |
| Fully controlled | High | Can be low (feels like tool) |

## Antagonist Development

### Making Villains Memorable

**The Villain Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear motivation (not "evil for evil's sake")
- [ ] Personal connection to player/world
- [ ] Competent (actual threat)
- [ ] Understandable (even if not sympathetic)
- [ ] Memorable presence (visual, audio, behavior)

### Boss Design Principles

For antagonists as gameplay encounters:

**Escalation Pattern:**
1. **Foreshadowing**: Hints before encounter
2. **Introduction**: Memorable first appearance
3. **Conflict**: Multiple encounters showing power
4. **Confrontation**: Final battle with full abilities
5. **Resolution**: Satisfying conclusion

**Boss Encounter Design:**
- Test skills the player has learned
- Introduce one new element
- Provide clear tells for attacks
- Allow for mastery improvement on retry

---

## Character Relationships

### Relationship Systems

For games with relationship mechanics:

**Simple Relationship:**
```
[Character] → [Like/Dislike] based on [player actions]
```

**Multi-Dimensional:**
```
[Character] → [Trust: X] [Affection: X] [Respect: X]
Different player actions affect different axes
```

### Relationship Dynamics

| Dynamic | Player Experience | Design Challenge |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Friendship | Warmth, support | Avoiding sycophancy |
| Romance | Emotional investment | Earning the connection |
| Rivalry | Motivation, competition | Making rival likeable |
| Mentorship | Growth, guidance | Mentor's limitations |
| Corruption | Dark choices matter | Consequences feel real |

---

## Character Economy

### How Many Characters?

**The Law of Character Economy:**
More characters = less development time per character

| Game Scope | Recommended Character Count |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Game jam | 3-5 total (1 PC, 2-4 NPCs) |
| Short game | 5-10 total |
| Medium game | 10-20 total |
| Long game | 20-40 total |

**Focus Resources On:**
1. Player character (most screen time)
2. Main antagonist (most conflict)
3. Key NPCs (most interaction)
4. Supporting cast (less depth needed)

### Reusing Character Assets

Maximize impact with limited assets:
- NPCs with multiple functions
- Antagonist with recurring encounters
- Companions that grow over time
- Named enemies vs generic enemies
