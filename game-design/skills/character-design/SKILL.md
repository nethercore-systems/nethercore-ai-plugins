# Character Design for Games

Frameworks for designing memorable characters. Every character exists to serve a purpose: design function before personality, then add personality that reinforces function.

## Core Principle: Function First

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Player characters** | Express player agency and skill |
| **NPCs** | Provide services, information, emotional connection |
| **Antagonists** | Create obstacles and motivation |
| **Companions** | Expand gameplay and relationships |

---

## Character Quick Design

**Hook formula:** "The [adjective] [archetype] who [unique trait or contradiction]"

**Three tests:**
1. **Silhouette test** — Recognizable from outline alone?
2. **Contradiction test** — More than their archetype?
3. **Function test** — Clear gameplay purpose?

## Player Character (PC)

### Blank Slate vs Defined

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Blank slate | Player projects themselves | Less narrative depth |
| Defined character | Stronger story potential | May not identify |
| Hybrid | Balance of both | Complex to design |

**Key questions:** Does PC speak? How much backstory? What abilities start/unlock?

---

## NPC Roles

| Role | Function | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Mentor** | Teaches, guides | Tutorial giver, wise figure |
| **Merchant** | Trades resources | Shopkeeper |
| **Quest giver** | Provides objectives | Village elder |
| **Ally** | Assists gameplay | Combat helper |
| **Gatekeeper** | Controls access | Guard |
| **Flavor** | World texture | Townsfolk |

**Key Rule:** Every NPC serves at least one clear function.

See **`references/npc-roles.md`** for detailed patterns.

## Antagonist Types

| Type | Relationship | Design Focus |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Rival** | Equal competitor | Mirror of player |
| **Tyrant** | Power imbalance | Oppressive presence |
| **Monster** | Inhuman threat | Primal fear |
| **Fallen hero** | What player could become | Tragic connection |

### Villain Checklist
- [ ] Clear motivation (not evil for evil's sake)
- [ ] Personal connection to player/world
- [ ] Competent (actual threat)
- [ ] Understandable (even if not sympathetic)
- [ ] Memorable presence

See **`references/antagonist-design.md`** for boss design patterns.

## Character Arc Template

```
WANT: What they desire
NEED: What they actually need (often different)
LIE: False belief holding them back
TRUTH: Realization enabling growth
CHANGE: How they're different at end
```

| Arc | Pattern | Payoff |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Positive | Flaw → Growth | Hope, satisfaction |
| Negative | Virtue → Fall | Tragedy, warning |
| Flat | Tested → Proven | Affirmation |

---

## Character Progression

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Unlock** | Gain new abilities | Metroidvanias |
| **Upgrade** | Improve existing | Roguelikes, RPGs |
| **Transform** | Fundamentally change | Story-driven |
| **Equip** | Change via items | Loot games |
| **Master** | Player skill grows | Skill-based |

---

## Character Economy

**Law of Character Economy:** More characters = less development per character.

| Scope | Character Count |
|-------|-----------------|
| Game jam | 3-5 total |
| Short game | 5-10 |
| Medium game | 10-20 |
| Long game | 20-40 |

**Focus resources on:** PC (most screen time), main antagonist (most conflict), key NPCs (most interaction).
