# Spatial Design Checklist

Quick-reference checklist for level design review.

---

## Navigation

- [ ] Player can identify current objective location
- [ ] Landmarks are visible from multiple angles
- [ ] Color/lighting guides toward goals
- [ ] Dead ends are short or rewarding
- [ ] Backtracking reveals new perspectives/shortcuts
- [ ] Map/minimap matches actual layout (if present)

---

## Sightlines

- [ ] Important destinations visible before reaching them
- [ ] Threats visible before entering combat range
- [ ] Secrets have subtle visual hints
- [ ] Vantage points reward exploration
- [ ] No accidental spoilers of later content

## Pacing Spaces

| Space Type | Characteristics | Checklist |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Safe zone** | No enemies, resources available | [ ] Clear boundaries [ ] Player knows they're safe |
| **Transition** | Light challenge, connects areas | [ ] Appropriate length [ ] Some interest/variety |
| **Combat arena** | Defined battle space | [ ] Cover exists [ ] Movement options [ ] Clear boundaries |
| **Chokepoint** | Controlled encounter | [ ] Visible before entering [ ] Retreat possible |
| **Vista** | Scenic overlook | [ ] Rewards exploration [ ] Provides orientation |

---

## Combat Spaces

- [ ] Entry/exit points defined
- [ ] Cover positions balanced
- [ ] Flanking routes exist (or intentionally don't)
- [ ] Verticality creates tactical options
- [ ] Space matches enemy count and types
- [ ] Player positioning matters
- [ ] Retreat is possible (or intentionally isn't)

---

## Exploration

- [ ] Optional paths are findable but not obvious
- [ ] Detours reward with items/lore/shortcuts
- [ ] Secrets have fair hints
- [ ] 100% completion is achievable
- [ ] Returning to areas is worthwhile (new perspectives, unlocked paths)

---

## Teaching Spaces

- [ ] New mechanic introduced in safe environment first
- [ ] Practice opportunity before test
- [ ] Failure doesn't strand player
- [ ] Success is clearly communicated
- [ ] Mastery has optional challenge

---

## Flow Validation

| Question | Answer | Fix If No |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Can player always find the way forward? | Y/N | Add guidance cues |
| Are challenge and rest balanced? | Y/N | Adjust encounter density |
| Do secrets feel fair? | Y/N | Add subtle hints |
| Does level match target time? | Y/N | Add/remove content |
| Is backtracking minimized? | Y/N | Add shortcuts |

## Final Checks

- [ ] Playtest with someone unfamiliar with design
- [ ] Time the critical path
- [ ] Verify all secrets are reachable
- [ ] Check for stuck states
- [ ] Ensure difficulty curve matches intent
