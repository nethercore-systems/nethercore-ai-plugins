### Cause and Effect

- Why hasn't someone solved this problem before?
- What happens as result of player actions?
- Are there plot holes?

## Consistency Red Flags

Watch for these common problems:

**"Because it's a game"** — If you're using this to explain something, reconsider the design

**The competent villain problem** — If the villain is smart, why haven't they won already?

**The helpful shopkeeper** — Why does the shopkeeper sell weapons to the person fighting their suppliers?

**The suicidal guard** — Why do guards attack the legendary hero who just killed a dragon?

**The amnesiac world** — Why does no one remember the player's previous actions?

**The convenient barrier** — Why is this specific obstacle impassable when similar ones aren't?

## Consistency Tiers

Not all inconsistencies are equal:

**Critical (must fix):**
- Breaks core gameplay systems
- Contradicts explicit rules you've established
- Creates narrative plot holes

**Significant (should fix):**
- Breaks immersion for attentive players
- Creates logic gaps
- Undermines world believability

**Minor (fix if time permits):**
- Nitpicks only some players notice
- Edge cases in systems
- Small immersion breaks

**Acceptable (don't worry):**
- Standard game conventions (health pickups, save points)
- Abstractions for playability (inventory space)
- Widely accepted genre tropes

---

## Final Verification

Before considering world design complete:

- [ ] Walk through the entire game mentally, checking for contradictions
- [ ] Have someone else review for logic gaps
- [ ] Document intentional exceptions to rules
- [ ] Create reference document for maintaining consistency during development
