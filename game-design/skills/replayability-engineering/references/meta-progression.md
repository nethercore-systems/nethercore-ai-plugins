## Pacing Formula

```
Early (runs 1-10): 1 unlock per run
Mid (runs 10-50): 1 unlock per 2-3 runs
Late (runs 50-100): 1 unlock per 5-10 runs
End (100+): Major unlocks, mastery challenges
```

## Power Creep Prevention

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Permanent stats too high | Cap or diminishing returns |
| Unlocks trivialize game | Unlock variety, not power |
| New players overwhelmed | Progressive unlock reveal |
| Veterans bored | Endless/challenge modes |
