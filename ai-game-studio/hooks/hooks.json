INTEGRATION CHECK:\n   - Is module in lib.rs?\n   - Is state initialized in init()?\n   - Is update() called in main update()?\n   - Is render() called in main render()?\n\n3. ASSET CHECK: Are required assets connected?\n   - Assets in nether.toml?\n   - Handles in src/assets.rs?\n   - Handles used in feature code?\n\n4.
