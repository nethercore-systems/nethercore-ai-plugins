## Problem

Not covered. Critical for game quality but no guidance exists.

## What's Missing

- Screen shake implementation
- Hit pause / freeze frames
- Particle effects basics
- Sound-visual synchronization
- Input responsiveness

## Prompt for Implementation

```
Add skill "game-feel" to nethercore-zx-game-design. Triggers: "game feel", "juice",
"polish", "screen shake", "particles", "impact", "feedback". Cover: screen shake,
hit pause/freeze frames, particle basics, sound-visual sync, anticipation-action-
follow-through, input responsiveness. Tie to ZX FFI (camera, timing, audio). Include
code snippets. ~1000 words.
```

## Dependencies
