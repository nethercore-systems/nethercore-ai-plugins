# Gap 7: Level Design Patterns

**Status:** `[ ]` Not Started
**Priority:** LOW
**Plugin:** nethercore-zx-game-design
**Type:** Skill

## Problem

Not covered. No guidance for spatial content design beyond procedural asset generation.

## What's Missing

- Tile-based level design for 2D games
- 3D level layout principles
- Procedural level generation patterns
- Pacing and difficulty curves

## Prompt for Implementation

```
Add skill "level-design" to nethercore-zx-game-design. Triggers: "level design",
"tile map", "world layout", "level generation", "map design". Cover: tile-based
design (2D platformer patterns), 3D spatial layout (third-person), procedural
generation basics (rooms, corridors), pacing/difficulty curves. Tie to ZX
constraints (ROM budget for level data). Use references/ for layouts. ~1200 words.
```

## Dependencies
