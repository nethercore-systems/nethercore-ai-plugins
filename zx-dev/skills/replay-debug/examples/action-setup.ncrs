# Action-Based Test Setup Example
# Demonstrates using debug actions to skip menus and set up test scenarios
# Replace action names/params with those registered in your game

console = "zx"
seed = 42
players = 1

# === SETUP PHASE ===
# Use debug actions to quickly reach the test scenario

# Skip the main menu (if registered)
[[frames]]
f = 0
action = "Skip Menu"

# Load level 3 directly (if registered)
[[frames]]
f = 1
action = "Load Level"

# Position player near the wall for collision testing (if registered)
[[frames]]
f = 2
action = "Set Position"
action_params = { x = 180.0, y = 50.0 }

# === TEST PHASE ===
# Now run the actual test - player should be near wall

# Capture initial state after setup
[[frames]]
f = 3
p1 = "idle"
snap = true

# Move right toward wall
[[frames]]
f = 4
p1 = "right"

# Continue moving - should approach wall
[[frames]]

p1 = "right"
snap = true

# Should be blocked by wall - position shouldn't change much
[[frames]]
f = 20
p1 = "right"
snap = true

# Still pushing into wall
[[frames]]
f = 30
p1 = "right"
snap = true

# Release and verify final state
