# Genre-Specific Templates

Starting points and patterns for different musical styles.

## Orchestral (RPG, Adventure)

### Structure
```
Theme and Variations:
- Establish main theme (16 bars)
- Variation 1: Different instrumentation
- Variation 2: Different key
- Development: Combine themes
- Return to main theme
```

### Layering
| Section | Role | When |
|---------|------|------|
| Strings | Foundation, emotion | Always |
| Brass | Power, heroics | Climax |
| Woodwinds | Color, melody | Lighter moments |
| Percussion | Drama, rhythm | Action, builds |

### Key Elements
- Full dynamic range (ppp to fff)
- Call and response between sections
- Building crescendos
- Counterpoint and harmony
- Hall reverb (2-4s decay)

---

## Electronic (Action, Racing, Sci-Fi)

### Structure
```
Build and Drop:
- Intro (ambient, building)
- Build (add elements, risers)
- Drop (full energy)
- Breakdown (reduce elements)
- Repeat
```

### Layering
| Element | Role | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Kick | Foundation | 4/4 pulse |
| Bass | Low-end | Sidechain to kick |
| Lead | Melody | Supersaw, FM |
| Pad | Atmosphere | Filtered, wide |
| Arp | Motion | 16th notes |

### Key Elements
- Sidechain compression (pumping)
- Filter sweeps for transitions
- Risers and impacts
- Layered drums for power
- Plate or digital reverb

---

## Chiptune (Retro, Indie)

### Structure
```
Simple Loops:
- A section (8-16 bars)
- B section (8-16 bars)
- Repeat
```

### Channel Allocation (4-channel)
| Channel | Use | Waveform |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Pulse 1 | Lead melody | 25% or 50% duty |
| Pulse 2 | Harmony/bass | 50% duty |
| Triangle | Bass | Triangle |
| Noise | Drums | Periodic/white |

### Key Elements
- Limited polyphony (3-4 voices)
- Arpeggio for chords
- Noise channel for drums
- Duty cycle for expression
- No reverb (dry)

### Techniques
- Echo via delayed note repeats
- Vibrato via pitch modulation
- Volume envelope for expression
- Channel stealing for complexity

---

## Ambient (Puzzle, Exploration, Horror)

### Structure
```
Evolving Texture:
- No clear sections
- Slow evolution over time
- Generative elements possible
```

### Layering
| Element | Duration | Role |
|---------|----------|------|
| Drone | 30-60s evolving | Foundation |
| Pad | 10-30s evolving | Harmony |
| Texture | Random triggers | Detail |
| Melody | Sparse, floating | Occasional |

### Key Elements
- Long reverb tails (5-30s)
- Slow filter movements
- Overlapping drones
- Sparse melodic fragments
- Negative space important

### Variation Techniques
- Different loop lengths (15s + 17s + 21s = long before repeat)
- Random element triggering
- Generative systems

---

## Dark Ambient (Horror)

### Structure
```
Tension and Release:
- Extended silence/drone
- Sudden intrusion
- Return to unease
```

### Layering
| Element | Role | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Drone | Foundation | Low, menacing |
| Texture | Unease | Scrapes, creaks |
| Dissonance | Tension | Clusters, microtones |
| Stingers | Scares | Sudden, loud |

### Key Elements
- Massive, dark reverb
- Detuned, unstable pitch
- Slow modulation
- Silence as element
- Sudden volume changes

---

## Synthwave (Retro-Futurism)

### Structure
```
80s Pop Format:
- Intro (arps building)
- Verse (groove established)
- Pre-chorus (build)
- Chorus (full power)
- Repeat with variations
```

### Layering
| Element | Sound | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| Bass | Analog, pulsing | Foundation |
| Lead | Saw, lush | Melody |
| Arp | Gated, sequenced | Motion |
| Drums | 80s machine | Drive |
| Pad | Wide, lush | Atmosphere |

### Key Elements
- Gated reverb on drums
- Thick chorus on leads
- Tempo-synced delay
- Major key nostalgia
- Driving 4/4 beats

---

## Lo-Fi (Chill, Nostalgic)

### Structure
```
Loop-Based:
- Short loops (4-8 bars)
- Minimal variation
- Sample-based aesthetic
```

### Key Elements
- Vinyl crackle overlay
- Low-pass filtering (remove highs)
- Tape wobble/wow
- Jazz-influenced harmony (7ths, 9ths)
- Swing/off-grid timing
- Room reverb + lo-fi verb

### Processing Chain
```
Source → Low-pass → Tape Saturation → Room Reverb → Vinyl Noise
```
